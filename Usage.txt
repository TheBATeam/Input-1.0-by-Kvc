 Input (v1.0) | by Kvc
 As Cmd has a limitation of not getting both, mouse and Keyboard inputs
 togehter, but we can get either keyboard or mouse input separately via
 various external plugins... like 'batbox.exe', 'fn.dll', 'bg.exe' etc.

 But, this plugin here... will allow you to get both inputs given by user
 It will return, the input was mouse 'm' or Keyboard 'k' and corresponding
 related data for the input.
