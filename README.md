## DETECTING – THE KEYBOARD INPUT
When the user presses any key via keyboard, e.g. ‘K‘. Then the plugin will return the following kind of output.

```k:K:75```
* Here, First ‘k‘ represents that the user has given input via Keyboard. 
* And, Second ‘K‘ represents the key pressed on the keyboard.
* The last parameter will tell you the ASCII Code for the key pressed.
As in some of the previous plugins, (like Batbox) they return the ASCII Code instead of character. So, this plugin contains both properties. You can use anyone, either key directly or its ASCII Code in your program.

## DETECTING – THE MOUSE INPUT
When the user presses any key via mouse, e.g. ‘Left Click‘. Then the plugin will return the following kind of output.

```m:1:75:6```
* Here, First ‘m‘ represents that the user has given input via Mouse. 
* And, Second ‘1’ represents the key pressed on the Mouse.
* The last parameter will tell you the X & Y Co-ordinates of the mouse clicking location on CMD console.
